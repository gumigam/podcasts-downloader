# podcasts-downloader
podcasts downloader from rss feed
This script was created to download multiple podcasts in one click
The use is simple: paste the rss link and select the number of episodes to download (if you want all the episodes just enter a number like 10000000000...)
A great feature of this script is that it creates a file called pod_list.lst that contains information about all the downloaded episodes,
So if you downloaded some episodes they will never be downloaded again to avoid duplication.
